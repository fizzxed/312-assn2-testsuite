# Testcases for 312 HW2

It seems the hidden test suite doesn't check order extensively since the
reference solution shows inconsistent behavior with the handout. Here are some
orderless test cases.

    labt/ for sec2/
    matcht/ for sec3/

**Note1:** Even reference solution failed some test cases, so... caveat
emptor...

**Note2:** `tests.sml` will be overwritten. If you want to keep it, please backup

Feel free to fork and make pull request to add more test cases
